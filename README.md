# Classic-Arcade-Game
Project nÂº4 for Udacity's FEND "Classic Arcade Game Clone"

## Project Instructions
Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

## Installing the Game
1. Download or Clone the repository: <br> *git clone* https://github.com/ElenaNovikova/Classic-Arcade-Game/
2. Load **index.html** in your browser.
